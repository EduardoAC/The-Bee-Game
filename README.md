#The Bee Game

##Objective
The objective of this exercise is to create a .net MVC application that performs the following
tasks:

- A web page must be produced as the interface to play the game. Styling is not
expected nor necessary.
- A button must be present to kick off the process of hitting a random bee.
- All code must be submitted to work in a local environment. Hosted solutions will be rejected.
- The game must adhere to specification.
- The game logic should be implemented in C# with an html UI. You may use any readily available libs that you wish.

##Specification
###Bees
There are three types of bees in this game:

- Queen Bee
The Queen Bee has a lifespan of 100 Hit Points.
When the Queen Bee is hit, 8 Hit Points are deducted from her lifespan.
If/When the Queen Bee has run out of Hit Points, All remaining alive Bees automatically run out of hit points.
There is only 1 Queen Bee.

- Worker Bee
Worker Bees have a lifespan of 75 Hit Points.
When a Worker Bee is hit, 10 Hit Points are deducted from his lifespan.
There are 5 Worker Bees.

- Drone Bee
Drone Bees have a lifespan of 50 Hit Points.
When a Drone Bee is hit, 12 Hit Points are deducted from his lifespan.
There are 8 Drone Bees.

###Gameplay
To play, there must be a button that enables a user to “hit” a random bee. The selection of a
bee must be random. When the bees are all dead, the game must be able to reset itself with
full life bees for another round.

###Constraints
The application must run through a browser
